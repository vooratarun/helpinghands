				Money collection is through draw boxes.
				The draw boxes are positioned at academic blocks of 
				each batch (For PUC they are placed at each cluster and 
				for Engineering batches they placed at academic blocks).
				Students can contribute money through these draw boxes. 
				Money is taken and count in the presence of working committee and deposited in the SBH account. The details will be displayed in the website.
